The code can be used for training/testing PyTorch models. It is used in the
[O-CNN](https://github.com/octree-nn/ocnn-pytorch) and my daily experiments.
It is similar to `pytorch-lightning`, but with much simpler implementations.
It can be installed via `pip` and used as a library:

- Install via the following command:
    ``` shell
    pip install thsolver
    ```

- Alternatively, install from the source code via the following commands.
    ``` shell
    git clone https://github.com/octree-nn/solver-pytorch.git
    pip install ./solver-pytorch
    ```

Welcome to use it and give me feedbacks via github issues or pull requests.
Thanks!
